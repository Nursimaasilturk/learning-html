		<h1>THE INTERNET </h1>
		<h2>What is the Internet ?</h2>
		<p>The internet is the world’s most popular computer network. 
			It began as an academic research project in 1969, and became
			 a global commercial network in the 1990s. Today it is used by more 
			 than 2 billion people around the world.</p>
        <h2>Where is the Internet ?</h2>
		<h3>The internet has three basic parts:</h3>
		<p>The last mile is the part of the internet that connects homes and small 
			businesses to the internet. Currently, about 60 percent of residential internet
			 connections in the United States are provided by cable TV companies such as Comcast 
			 and Time Warner.<p>
		<p>Data centers are rooms full of servers that store user data and host online apps and 
			content. Some are owned by large companies such as Google and Facebook. Others are
			 commercial facilities that provide service to many smaller websites. Data centers 
			 have very fast internet connections, allowing them to serve many users simultaneously.
			  Data centers can be located anywhere in the world, but they are often located in 
			  remote areas where land and electricity are cheap. For example, <strong>Google</strong>,<strong> Facebook</strong>,
			   and <b>Microsoft</b> have all constructed vast data centers in Iowa.</p>
		<p> <em> Backbone </em> consists of long-distance networks — mostly on fiber optic cables — 
			that carry data between data centers and consumers. The backbone market is highly 
			competitive. Backbone providers frequently connect their networks together at internet
			 exchange points, usually located in major cities. Establishing a presence at IEPs 
			 makes it much easier for backbone providers to improve their connections to others.

		<h2>Who created the Internet ?</h2>
		<p>The internet began as <i> ARPANET</i>, an academic research network that was funded by the military’s Advanced 
			Research Projects Agency (ARPA, now DARPA). The project was led by Bob Taylor, an ARPA administrator,
			 and the network was built by the consulting firm of Bolt, Beranek and Newman. It began operations in 1969.</p>
